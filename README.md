# LlamaGPS

This project is a demonstration of my skills in React, C# and Unity 3D.
In this simple game, you need to find all the llamas on that island and place them on the ZOO farm.

I'm another llama wanting to join the team.

[Demo] (https://github.com/Sopzak/LlamaGPS).

## Project Structure
The Unity and .Net projects are in different solutions, but in the same folder.

## Futures Updates
In this project, you have a structure to create more llamas for a team of llamas.
The backend is in a .Net application with C# and React to create llamas via a Rest API.
The Unity game takes the information from the API and puts the llamas on the island.
